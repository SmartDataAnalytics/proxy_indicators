would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . \n right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious \n that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ? \n i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute \n i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way \n ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military \n i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe \n ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion \n i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 . \n ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! ! \n it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them . \n ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc \n\n", "fact": "[ # 26 score:167 comments:24 ] - til - the trunk of your car is

historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i \u2019m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house . \n like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson . \n though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though . \n i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead . \n what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's \n they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously
